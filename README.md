# Physics-inspired-Deeep-Learning
Physics Inspired Deep Learning is among the most powerful approximation method for complex systems
of partial differential equations. In this study, we use unsupervised learning to approximate the
solution of the two-dimensional heat equation while considering the physical laws that are presented in
the equation. We expanded our research to include image denoising using the supervised learning
approach and the heat equation. We experimented with both isotropic and anisotropic diffusion
methods to address noise reduction in images. The experimental results show that physics-inspired
deep learning solution of the heat equation is more realistic compared to that of existing methods.
Also, anisotropic diffusion denoised image more accurately compared to that of isotropic diffusion
